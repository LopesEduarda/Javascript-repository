// Section 2
// 12. Data Types

// Let's take a look in all the types that we have in JavaScript
// It's important to remember that in javascript every value is either an object or a primitive value

// This is an object
let me = { 
    name: 'Eduarda'
};

// This is a primitive value
let firstName = 'Maria';
let age = 30;
// A value is only a primitive when it's not an object
